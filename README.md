Before running InstaFind.py in Python compatible IDE you must pip install these individual Python modules with the following commands in this order (if pip is not recognized as a command type you must add the file holding your python scripts to your windows environment paths):
-------
pip install opencv-python
pip install cmake
pip install pillow
pip install dlib (if wheel error ensues download pip install WHL file that comes with this package)
pip install face_recognition 
pip install numpy
--------
When running InstaFind.py the termianl may urge you to run a pip command to install default face recognition models via command terminal, in which case you should comply. 
Thank you.
